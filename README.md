Virtual private network
A virtual private network extends a private network across a public network and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. Applications running across a VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network. Encryption is a common, although not an inherent, part of a VPN connection. VPN technology was developed to provide access to corporate applications and resources to remote or mobile users, and to branch offices.
